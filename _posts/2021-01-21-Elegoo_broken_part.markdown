# Unpacking

![Elegoo SmartRobot v4.0](/assets/elegoo-001.jpg)

A few days ago I decided to order an Elegoo smartrobot with a camera based on the ESP32-Wrover.
The whole procedure of unpacking, putting pieces together and connecting cables was quite
fun to be honest, together with backround music and a few beers.

As you see in the following picture, those are most of the parts that come with the kit.

Unfortunately after delivery and opening the package, I found out the support plate for the 
camera was broken, as shown in the red box in the following image.

# Solution : 3D Printing

Next to the broken camera support, there is a newly 3D printed base. That was a quick fix.

The link to the 3D part is here: [3D Model](https://github.com/cruzgarcia/3d_printing)

At the end, the robot looks nice and wating to have some fun and hardware modifications ;)!
